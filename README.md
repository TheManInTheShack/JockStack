# JockStack

What is new Jock called?

# Premise
Begin with one Jock, who is Jock. As new Jocks are added, they are arranged by size, relative to the other Jocks. Once a Jock is named, that's his name. Jock Stack is capable of moving in either direction infinitely, if bigger or smaller Jocks are added.


# Analytical possibilities:
- Medium-Sized Jock may or may not be accurately named when he arrives - what is the range and frequency of his variations?
- What is the average size of the names and how does it scale over time
- Surely there are some mathematical models that just fit the way these are constructed...there has to be, so what are they?  It's tree shit, right? IDK math.
- There will be a 'spectroscopy' of the names that is unique to this, because we have a finite range of patterns that will occur with some frequency.  How does that work, and how do we analyze and display that meaningfully?
- Once the names are constructed, there is no context of parentheses.  Can we build a thing to unravel it and determine where a complex construction actually lies?  Meaning, could we start with the list of names, and accurately put them back in the original randomized order.
