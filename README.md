# JockStack

What is new Jock called?

# Premise
Begin with one Jock, who is Jock. As new Jocks are added, they are arranged by size, relative to the other Jocks. Once a Jock is named, that's his name. Jock Stack is capable of moving in either direction infinitely, if bigger or smaller Jocks are added.

# Upgrade possibilities:
- Command line interface (done)
- Bidirectionality of reference - so can be smaller-than, in addition to bigger-than (added)
- Relative size sometimes matters - with a threshold, there might be a much-bigger-than, etc. (added, tweakable)
- More unique names with a random chance to come up and override the size chart - Young Jock, Old Jock, Red Jock, Blue Jock, etc.

- UI/webapp


# Analytical possibilities:
- Medium-Sized Jock may or may not be accurately named when he arrives - what is the range and frequency of his variations?
- What is the average size of the names and how does it scale over time
- Surely there are some mathematical models that just fit the way these are constructed...there has to be, so what are they?  It's tree shit, right? IDK math.
- There will be a 'spectroscopy' of the names that is unique to this, because we have a finite range of patterns that will occur with some frequency.  How does that work, and how do we analyze and display that meaningfully?
- Once the names are constructed, there is no context of parentheses.  Can we build a thing to unravel it and determine where a complex construction actually lies?  Meaning, could we start with the list of names, and accurately put them back in the original randomized order.
- What percent of the time does "No'-As-Big-As-Medium-Sized-Jock-But-Bigger-Than-Wee-Jock Jock" himself come up? There's a chance in each roll, but it's going to require a specific subset of the tree.  This is true for any name.
